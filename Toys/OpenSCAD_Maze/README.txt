# Summary

Okay, people had a really hard time using the last maze generator since it was programmed in a peculiar way.  

This one uses ASCII art.  It calculates the shape of the maze from the ASCII itself (which REQUIRES a pretty new OpenSCAD).  Or you can use the new (and untested!) maze different from last years'.  Enjoy.  

NOTE!  I haven't printed this maze yet!  I'll check it tomorrow :D  [edit] It prints, it works.  

[edit] Minor but important code fix in lmaze6a.scad  

[edit] Maze generator at http://burningsmell.org/maze.html  

The lid is in Sneakypoo's original labyrinth gift box, see "Sources".

# Instructions

You can use the premade maze, which is different from last years', or you can build your own by editing the "m" array to your liking.  You cannot change its dimensions.  

Hit F6, wait for it to render.  

Adjust aoff until the bump which holds it shut is in the right place.  F6, check, etc.  

Finally, F6, wait for it to render, file, export as STl, save, wait a minute, and you'll have your customized maze.
